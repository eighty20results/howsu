In order for the linkage allowing the level to be passed throughout the form process
I had to change the core plugin, short term.

Within the plugin core folder there is a file called Participants-Database.php.

On line 2273 there is this code:

$redirect = $post_input['action'] == 'insert' ? $post_data['thanks_page'] : self::add_uri_conjunction($post_data['thanks_page']) . 'action=update';

The $_SESSION['tempServiceLevel'] has had the level added in the custom signup form, at the bottom. So we just need to add this
to the end of the redriect.

So the new code looks like this:

$redirect = $post_input['action'] == 'insert' ? $post_data['thanks_page'] : self::add_uri_conjunction($post_data['thanks_page']) . 'action=update' . $_SESSION['tempServiceLevel'];

May need to be changed with certain updates.

Single_Class:

_no_record function:

added redirect to upgrade page.
